Hello! Welcome to the marianopolis codejam club. Here we'll be learning the fundations of competitive programming.

## Installing Python
First of all to learn python, you need to install it directly on your computer.

1. Go install python on the [microsoft store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pjpw5ldxlz5?hl=en-US&gl=US).
2. Go install vscode your code text editor that you'll be using to program in python from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. After installing vscode, go on the extensions page by pressing the bottom buttom from the left column of buttons or by using `Ctrl+Shift+X (or Shift+Command+X on macos)` 

4. There search python and you'll see a bunch of extensions. From those extensions located the one that looks like the figure below and click on install. You can trust&install the publisher(it is microsoft).

5. Now python should be installed. You can verify if the installation by going on your editor by cliking on the `...` at the top of the screen and by selectecting `Terminal` + `New Terminal`. This should open the terminal built in inside of vscode at the bottom of the viewport.

6. Now inside the terminal type `python` then press `enter`. This will open the python shell, inside the shell enter `print("Hello World")` and press `Enter`. If you see an `Hello World` below what you just type, this means that python was installed sucessfully.
